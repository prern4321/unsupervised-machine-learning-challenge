# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

We as a data science team of a medical research company have been assigned to find better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. 
By using unsupervised learning, we would need to separate group of distinct patients that would be better to analyze. 
We've been provided with raw Data that would need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. 
We would use clustering models to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. 
The visualizations created would be shared with the team and other officials
